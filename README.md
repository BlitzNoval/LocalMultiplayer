Welcome to Ultimate Tag Simulator 

The game is centred around a group of 2 friends who love playing tag with one another. It's a game that they all love and keep close to their hearts, in fact it's how they all met.

One day while they were playing they were abducted by Alien's who want to learn about the human race. The aliens were fascinated by this game they saw the friends playing, Tag, and enjoyed watching the friends play. So they devised a way to further their own entertainment and decided to abduct the friends, to give them the ultimate playing experience.

The friends' were placed into a tournament to prove who was the best at Tag. The alien's created The Ultimate Tag Arena, a stage for this tournament to take place. A dynamic arena that can be changed to give the friend's a new challenge in their game.
